# Debiasing-Student-Algorithms
This research mitigates bias in algorithms that are used for monitoring student progress. The motivation comes from the need to improve the fairness of education algorithms to ensure that they do not perpetuate any pre-existing biases. The significance of this issue is emphasized by incidents like the UK A-level grading controversy, which highlighted the potential harm that biased algorithms can cause in real-world scenarios.
